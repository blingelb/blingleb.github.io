                                searching through job postings in order to find common skills associated with each position. We
                                then took to researching additional sources related to those fields for opinions on UX design
                                written by industry-experienced professionals. From these activities we were able to compile
                                our learnings to fully understand the importance of UX design in our future endeavors.</p>

                                to gage the main gripes of the shopping expirience.  As a result, we created an app that aides 
                                college students in shopping based on selected recipes, giving a detailed walthrough of the store

                                combat cheating, something that's every-so common with these types of designs.  For our analysis, we
                                performed interviews with students with a wide-range of daily activity to see what motivates them to exercise.
                                Our final design was to designate times throughout the working day to encourage the user to get up from their
                                seat and go on a walk.  This is a form of micro-exercising, which is to encourage activity throughout the day 
                                and mitigate the effects of prolonged sitting.

        <h2 class="display-4 text-center section-title">Project Details</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project was to take the existing design of the popular Starship 
            delivery bots and change the mental model to create more human-to-human interaction. This project 
            allows the user to order a Starship projector to any location on Purdue's campus and create an outdoor
            movie experience. This experience can be shared with either friends or cultivate new friendships through
            a shared outdoor experience.</p>

        <!-- Ideation Section -->
        <h3 class="section-title">Ideation</h3>

        <p>In our initial brainstorm session, we came up with the following ideas:</p>
        <p><i>Book Delivery / Entertainment Exchange</i> - This idea involves mobile libraries in which Starships deliver books to students in exchange of a deposited book from that student, similar to public library booths found in parks.</p>    
        <p><i>Donations & Give Away</i> - At the end of the semester, leftover items such as school supplies, dorm supplies, food, etc. can be collected by the Starship and delivered to appropriate outlets for donations</p>
        <p><i>Donations & Give Away</i> - At the end of the semester, leftover items such as school supplies, dorm supplies, food, etc. can be collected by the Starship and delivered to appropriate outlets for donations</p>
        <p><i>Games</i> - Various games involved seeking out the Starships based on location and teamplay to encourage human-to-human collaboration</p>
        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> The ideation process was the first step into the design process and posed the first test for our group’s ability to conceptualize potential solutions for the project.  Originally, our group was dead set on the Book Delivery idea, which was created before the interview process.  However, after feedback from both our interviewees and our peers, we had to backpedal to a new idea.</p>
        

        <!-- Interview Section -->
        <h3 class="section-title">Interviews</h3>
        <p>For interviews, we decided to have a qualitative open-ended interview where each person could have their own interview protocol and ask whatever questions that come to mind. Below are the question categories shared between our interviews, and the key takeaways we got from each category.</p>
            
        <h4>Reading Questions</h4>
        <h6>Example Questions</h6>
        <p>Do you read books? How often do you read? Have you used a public library before? Would you read more if starship allowed book exchanges?</p>
        <h6>Key Takeaways</h6>
        <p>From reading questions, we hoped to gauge the practicality and interest of people regarding our book exchange idea. We learned that reading has become drastically uncommon, as many stated reading most during their primary education and during their adolescence. Additionally, most entertainment and leisure activities (including reading) are stated to be done digitally compared to their physical counterparts. We concluded that people aren’t interested in reading and book exchanges would not incentivize people enough to read.</p>

        <h4>Games/Hobbies/Ideas Questions</h4>
        <h6>Example Questions</h6>
        <p>How often do you play board games? Would you be interested in campus-wide games? What type of activities do you participate in?</p>
        <h6>Key Takeaways</h6>
        <p>From the ideas questions, we requested ideas and feedback from our interviewees regarding other ideas involving starships and how they felt about them. We knew beforehand that people are most active recreationally in the evening to night, especially Friday nights. We learned that people might consider participating in campus-wide games if it didn’t interfere with their day schedule. Ideas that physically interacted with the starship, like slapping, or kicking it, showed some potential. Most importantly, many said that they spend their free time in group leisure activities with friends after classes in the evening.</p>


        <!-- Post-Interview Section -->
        <h3 class="section-title">Post-Interview Evaluation</h3>
        <p>After evaluating interviews, we decided to revise our idea and think of something beside book exchange. We learned from our interviews, professor, and initial problem that there are three main points our idea should hit on: 1) human-to-human interaction (H2H), 2) reuse starship capabilities (why starship?), and 3) change the mindset regarding starships.</p>
        <h4>Final Idea</h4>
        <p>We decided on a “starship projector” idea that has a projector attached to it (a special starship robot) with small but powerful speakers inside the starship. Users would request a starship using the app at any location within campus radius. They can then watch a movie using the starship on any wall or an easy to set up projector screen that comes with the starship.</p>

        <!-- Midpoint Section -->
        <h3 class="section-title">Midpoint Evaluation</h3>
        <p>At this point, we had a solid idea, and the next step was to present and share our idea and get feedback on it from others who may notice things we didn’t, or have useful insights that we could incorporate into our idea. </p>
            
        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>Here are a couple of comments from our peers as well as an overall generalization of the feedback.</p>

        <h5>Positive</h5>
        <p><i>“The human-human interaction is great and really applicable, as I love projector movies with friends/family.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“Watching movies together is a good bonding experience, I like the idea of a deliverable projector and screen.“</i></p>
        <p><i>"I really like that it's creating an experience for people and a place to potentially meet new people.”</i></p>

        <h5>Criticism</h5>
        <p><i>“I am slightly concerned with how visible the movie would be outside?”</i></p>
        <p><i>“The screen sounds awesome but I wonder how you can implement it.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“Couldn’t this be open to people using this as pranks or harassment?“</i></p>

        <h5>Overall</h5>
        <p>Altogether, most of our feedback was very positive, as everybody agreed that starship movies are a unique idea that would provide a human-to-human interaction by leveraging the starship’s mobility. Overall, everyone stated that our idea fit all the criteria of the assignment in theory. </p>
        <p>However, many also reported concerns and issues about the idea.  The main concerns were about implementation practicality, such as the security of the projector, the appropriateness of the content displayed, and passerby inconveniences related to noise or crowding. This suggests that while many are onboard with the idea, they have reservations about it, which highlighted faults and cracks in our idea that we would have to revise before pitching the idea again.</p>

        <h4>Revisions</h4>
        <p>There will be a map app associated with starship-movies. As long as the host requests a movie robot, the spot he requested will appear on the map and people could see and join the movie. Also, the host can get an URL link and share it on any social media to invite people.</p>
        <p>There will be a restriction that people can only do movies in some areas. However, when people plan to do a movie night that is not in the allowed area, they can send a request and our staff will check whether the location is appropriate. If the location was approved, it will be added into the map and no more requests needed for future users to do projection on that area. </p>
        <p>If facing weather changes or any other situations that make the movie can’t continue, the starship robot will give an announcement 10 minutes before leaving. After 10 minutes, the robot will close the screen and leave. The host will get a refund and some coupons as compensation. </p>


        <!-- Final Section -->
        <h3 class="section-title">Final Features</h3>
        <h3>Final Features</h3>
        <h4>App</h4>
        <p>We will have a map app or collaborate with some map app to show the locations that has movie presenting. The user will use the app to send requests for a movie night, streaming movies through their video account (Netflix, Hulu, etc) and manage location requests and payment. Meanwhile, if there’s some issue like construction or road close, the map will also update to make an existing green area to be red. As a participant, users could check on the coming movie events. The app will gather the GPS data from users’ phones to estimate the people attending the movie event. If it’s beyond the recommended capacity of the area, a warning will be shown on the map. </p>

        <h4>Map</h4>
        <p>In the map feather in our app there will be some predetermined areas that can allow people to do movies. In the app, those areas will be colored as green or blue. The difference between blue and green is that the blue area is called the “happy zone” which allows people to project movies with fewer restrictions on brightness and volume. People can also project movies in red areas but only after being approved by our staff. After the approval, the area will become green for future movies. </p>

        <h4>Protection</h4>
        <p>To safeguard our robot and projector against potential damage, we've implemented a protective measure by enclosing the projector lens within a hinged shell. This arrangement ensures that the lens remains shielded while the robot is in motion, minimizing the risk of collisions. Additionally, we've opted not to implement protection measures during projection. Instead, we've chosen to restrict the robot's location to avoid projecting in crowded areas, thus reducing the likelihood of accidental damage. Furthermore, we've decided against implementing safeguards against intentional damage by users, as we trust in the integrity of Purdue students, believing that they will treat the equipment with care and respect.</p>

        <h4>Screen</h4>
        <p>There will be a foldable screen installed inside the robot. Once the projection is happening, the robot will eject the arm and unfold the screen. We are doing this to make it convenient for people to use our robot because no one would like to spend time installing and uninstalling the screen kit, and projecting movies directly on a random wall is of low quality. </p>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Most of the research involved shopper psychology in developing mental directories for handling themselves within a store. Mostly, shoppers have a general methodology, such as creating a (mental) list or internal pathing, when it comes to designing a route in a store based on the items they need the most. As a result of our research, we decided that a product should be made in order to aid the user in developing their internal pathing, especially as a new shopper.</p>

            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>Survey Analysis: From our survey, we concluded that from our audience of 18-25 year olds, a vast majority of them are shopping for themselves at least once every 1 - 2 weeks for around 1 - 10 items during a 1-hour session of shopping.</p>
            <p>Interview Results: I conducted an interview with several friends with a variety of different shopping habits. Some shop by going front to back and finding items while they shop. Others create a list and create a predetermined route in order to leave the store as quickly as possible. One thing is for certain, our design will need to accompany a user base of both of these types of shoppers.</p>

            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>Our target audience for our application are college students. College students primarily consist of young adults living on their own for the first time in their lives. This group has varying degrees of knowledge when it comes to cooking and shopping for themselves, and any tool that could aid them would be highly beneficial in this period of transition.</p>

        <div class="analysis-section">
            <h2>Final Solution</h2>
            <h3>Recipe Selection</h3>
            <p>The user can select a recipe and be presented with a list of items necessary to cook the recipe and what aisles in any local grocery store the item can be found in.</p>

            <h3>Recipe Recommendations</h3>
            <p>The app can recommend recipes to the user based on the user profile or by previous recipes the user has tried before. This will aid in people discovering new recipes they’ve never tried and even give them an opportunity to try new cultures cuisines they might not have attempted before.</p>

            <h3>Recipe Guide</h3>
            <p>The app will show the full recipe to the user including tips on how to perform certain steps if necessary.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to utilize user journey mapping in order to create an enhanced shopping experience. Journey mapping was used to create a user story revolving around college students who may or may not have experience in cooking and some of the perils that they may face when it comes to shopping/cooking for themselves for the first time.</p>
            <p>Our product was designed to focus on improving the shopping experience for less seasoned shoppers and provide them with a tool not just to aid them in cooking, but also provide additional food options/ideas that they wouldn’t have discovered otherwise.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Office workers tend to spend long hours sitting in one position with little to no movement. Studies have shown that a sedentary lifestyle can lead to several health concerns including cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes. Usually, this group doesn’t have time to dedicate to proper workout routines throughout the day if at all, and therefore require a solution to increase movement during the working day.</p>

            <h3>Intended User/Target Audience</h3>
            <p>Our intended audience is middle aged office workers (specific profession does not matter), who tend to spend the majority of their day seated and thus are the most at risk to health detriments as found in our research.</p>

            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
            <p>We’ve designed an app to promote users to get up from their work and take a walk. Essentially, the app simultaneously provides a break from work on top of promoting healthy outlets for those breaks via micro exercising. Micro Exercising encourages small bursts of activity throughout the day to encourage a healthy yet time-conscious alternative to other forms of break-taking (such as checking one's phone for 15 minutes).</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">AI assisted Design & Ideation</h2>
            <p>Our initial app idea includes a step counter along with a timer. The timer will remind the user to get up and take short walks in regular time intervals. The app will track the number of steps that the person has taken during these periods and tally them up. At the end of the day, the app will give the user a summary of their activity for a week. The summary will show them all the extra steps they took as a result of the reminders. This summary will also include the number of extra calories they burned and other relevant health information. The app hopes to encourage activity through the constant reminders. The summaries will serve to encourage users to not cheat their data, so they actually improve their health.</p>

            <h3>AI Evaluation</h3>
            <p>While the AI model was able to effectively generate an application with the desired parameters, it insisted on adding additional features that were not outlined within the initial prompt. For instance, the AI suggested achievements, streaks, goals, and even a leaderboard, all of which we believed would encourage cheating. As a result, the team decided to take some of the initial designs themselves of the app and improve upon them based on the ideation step.</p>

            <p>After the initial AI assisted design, we revised our UI layout. It was important for us to have a simple and effective layout that didn’t give the user more information than they needed. Each page displays a different necessary part of the design.</p>

            <p>Our final design is an app built around pressuring our users into not cheating by weaponizing the concept of guilt and using it against them. The bulk of our app is fairly similar to most fitness trackers as requested, displaying daily step count, analyzing calories burned, comparing steps taken across the entire week, etc. What differentiates our design from others is how we account for users taking calories in. We have presented a number of popular junk food items within the app and assigned each of them an appropriate corresponding number of steps. In theory if a user were to look at the page and then try to eat the junk food they saw anyway they will be guilted into putting in the proper exercise first. In other words, we are guilting our users.

        <p>This exercise is intended to educate us on the values of user experience as it pertains to our
            aspired professional careers. To accomplish this task, we analyzed the professional field by
            searching through job postings in order to find common skills associated with each position. We
            then took to researching additional sources related to those fields for opinions on UX design
            written by industry-experienced professionals. From these activities we were able to compile
            our learnings to fully understand the importance of UX design in our future endeavors.</p>

        <!-- Job Search Section -->
        <h3 class="section-title">Phase 1 - Job Search</h3>
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>The Job Search activity began with each of us exploring the web for a job position that matches
            our ideal dream job (where applicable). For those who had goals of entrepreneurship, they
            focused on finding the jobs they want that provide them with the experience and
            ability/opportunity to then later start their own company/business/studio.
            </p>
        <h4>Learnings</h4>
        <p>For my job posting, I decided to research a Lead Multiplayer Systems Programmer position at
            Bethesda Games Studios, known for Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and Starfield. This position
            required ample knowledge in C++, networking systems, and Linux, but also required soft skills
            such as Organization, Communication, and ‘passion for making GREAT games’, all of which are
            much more subjective. Most interestingly, a degree in Mathematics could supplement a degree
            in Computer Science for this position, assuming that the applicant possesses all the required
            technical skills. This posting demonstrates that companies require a high degree of technical
            skill, but most importantly a degree of interpersonal skills that benefit working within a small
            team in order to complete the larger picture</p>

        <!-- Secondary Research Section -->
        <h3 class="section-title">Phase 2 - Secondary Research</h3>
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>Each of the team members researched how UX Design is relevant in their respectives fields,
            and summarized their findings in the following results; detailing the specific roles, duties,
            implementations, and general design philosophies that are integral to UX in the industries.
            </p>
        <h4>Learnings</h4>
        <p>These articles detail UX approaches when utilizing React Native, which is a mobile application
            development platform used by major software companies such as Facebook, Microsoft,
            Amazon, etc. Each article is relatively consistent with each other, emphasizing responsiveness,
            consistency, and user-centered design. One interesting push from both articles I noticed was
            the importance of Branding when it comes to creating designs. Branding essentially means that
            the app should have a unique design focus that is consistent with not just the current
            application, but with any subsequent applications that are developed by the same company.
            This can range from logos, to color schemes, to just conscious design choices that are
            consistent with the company.

        <!-- Reflection Section -->
        <h3 class="section-title">Phase 3 - Reflection</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite findings from my research was the effectiveness of Branding when it comes
            to UX design for mobile applications. Branding is essentially making conscious choices that
            repeat throughout the design of an application that reflect the company. This can be through a
            color scheme, the use of logos, to even familiar design choices that are replicated not just
            through one application, but every application that one company produces.</p>
        <p>I chose to focus on React Native because of my previous experience with the app through my
            internship. The platform is incredibly flexible when it comes to designing applications that follow
            the UX principles outlined both in class and in my research, including readability, branding, and
            ease of access.</p>
